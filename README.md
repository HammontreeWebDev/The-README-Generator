  ## Description
  This project provides a simple solution for any developer of any skill-level to create a professional looking README. In fact, this readme was created using the app you are looking at! It was created using node.js and will prompt the user to answer a series of questions that will help the application build a README quickly so that developers can do what they want to the most... CODE!!!
  ## Installation
  Fork this repository to your GitHub page and clone it to your local machine. Once you have it open in your favorite code editor (mine is VS Code), then  you can run npm install to install the required dependancies for the application to run properly.
  ## Usage
  To use this application, after installation, simply type "node index.js" or "npm start" into an integrated terminal. Then, answer the questions and a README will be generated for you!
